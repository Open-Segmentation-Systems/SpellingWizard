**SpellingWizard** is simple yet feature rich spelling app. As opposed to other spelling apps that have a robotic voice to pronounce the words and an archaic user experience, SW has :

  * a **userfriendly**, and **beautiful** interface (as well as addtional themes to choose from)
  * An **awesome** and **clear** human voice.

**SpellingWizard** will be available on **PlayStore and F-droid**.

### Why does this app have a preminum version for Playstore users?
As publishing an app on the playstore requires money, we've decided to have one-time-paid preminum features. However, we value the privacy and freedom of users to not be tracked by Google or even use google products and thus we will always provide the app freely, and with every feature in F-droid.

### Premium features (DOES NOT CONCERN F-DROID USERS)
Paying the premium version on PlayStore unlocks additional features. This list may be extended in futures versions.

* New shiny color themes
* Ability to review, and practice your mistakes until you've mastered them.

**These features will always stay freely available for downloads from F-droid!**
